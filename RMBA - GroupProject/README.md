# RMBA Project â€“ HR Analytics and Employee Attrition Analysis

This repository contains a statistical analysis project completed for the course **Research Methods for Business Analytics**, focused on understanding employee attrition through data exploration, assumption testing, and regression modeling.

## Overview

- **Goal:** Explore HR data and model employee attrition using statistical methods.
- **Course Context:** Emphasis on statistical rigor, including assumption checking, variable selection, and model interpretation.

## Workflow

- Load and inspect the dataset
- Perform EDA and visualize key trends
- Check statistical assumptions (e.g., normality, multicollinearity)
- Build and interpret regression models
- Report findings and business implications

## Data Source

Synthetic HR dataset commonly used for business analytics instruction. No real employee data was used.

## Results

- Statistically significant predictors of attrition identified (e.g., income, distance, satisfaction)
- Assumptions tested and documented
- Results interpreted using odds ratios and business context
