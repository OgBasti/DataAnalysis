# Assignment 1 – COVID-19 Data Analysis with Pandas

This project analyzes real-world COVID-19 daily report data to answer analytical questions using Python and Pandas.

## Overview
- **Goal:** Explore, clean, and analyze COVID-19 daily reports to extract insights and answer 13 structured data analysis questions.
- **Data:** Daily report for January 1, 2023, from the CSSE COVID-19 Data Repository (Johns Hopkins University).
